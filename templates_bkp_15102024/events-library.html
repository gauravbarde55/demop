It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p class="text-justify">The 21st century is ruled by data and in reality, it is turning out to be the ‘blood’ of this technology-driven era. From multinational companies to small startups, every organization today requires a Data Scientist.</p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">The function of a data scientist is getting more important for a traditional organization because big data is constantly transforming business strategies and marketing skills and data scientists are the core of this change. Rather than simply collecting, mining, and making sense of data, data scientists are industry experts with specialist, in-depth domain knowledge. Data scientists design data modeling processes, create algorithms and predictive models to extract the data the business needs, and help analyze the data and share insights with peers.
        By many accounts, becoming a data scientist is said to be a highly desirable career path. Harvard Business Review called data science “the sexiest job of the 21st century,” noting that “high-ranking professionals with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data” are in major demand.
        Making a career in this avenue is lucrative, but many people are skeptical of their growth as data scientists. To help them accelerate their career as data scientist, the BSE Institute has organized a webinar by Mr. Anurodh Gupta, Head of Data Science Compliance in Societe Generale GSC.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">As the world is revolutionizing, even stock broking has evolved. In this new era, digital techniques are used in trading to help in the complex calculation of buying and selling of stocks and one of the emerging techniques in talks is Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
        
        <p class="text-justify">APIs have become increasingly popular tools, with the likes of Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, SalesForce, and many more establishing their own APIs that allow companies to access some of their services without having to fully migrate into their ecosystem.
        API is a tool that has helped in making trading easy. Earlier, retail traders were forced to screen for opportunities in one application and separately place trades with their broker, but today many retail brokers provide APIs that enable traders to directly connect their screening software with the brokerage account to share real-time prices and place orders.
        API can also be used to customize trading platforms as per the user, or even upgrade their advisory services. The API also helps to integrate with third party advanced trading and charting tools. But this is not it, there is much more to the API concept, to help guide in the process of understanding API, the BSE institute has organized a webinar on ‘Open API revolution in India Stock Broking Industry’ by Mr. Raghava BS, Director of Products at CoinSwitch Kuber.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Investment banking is becoming increasingly significant today as more and more companies are interested in stocks and bonds to raise capital, but executing these transactions requires special expertise, from pricing financial instruments in a way that will maximize revenues to navigating regulatory requirements. That’s where investment banking comes into picture.</p>
        
         <p class="text-justify">An investment banker knows the best way to raise funds by getting creative with financial models while remaining within the law. They are valued by the finance world as they advise a wide range of clients spread all across the world on their capital raising and M&amp;A needs. In essence, investment banks are a bridge between large enterprises and the investor. Their primary roles are to advise businesses and governments on how to meet their financial challenges and to help them procure financing, whether it be from stock offerings, bond issues, or derivative products.
        As there is a wide range of responsibilities, there is also a vast scope in investment banking. An individual pursuing a career in investment banking can get a designation of an Analyst, Associate, Vice President, Director, Managing Director, Head, Vice Chair, or any other special title, to pursue a career in investment banking. The first question is how and where to start? To answer this the BSE Institute Ltd. has organized a webinar on "Careers in Investment Banking" by Mr. Ramnish Kochgave, President of Investment banking and Head Equity Markets at Elara Capital.</p>
